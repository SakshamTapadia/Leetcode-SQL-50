# LeetCode-SQL-Solutions

## Description 
This repository contains my solutions to the SQL 50 challenge on LeetCode, which provides an extensive collection of SQL problems covering a wide range of concepts and techniques.

The challenge includes easy, medium, and hard level questions from various topics.

## Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by SQL concepts in the following folders:
- `Selects/`: Basic selection queries
- `Basic Joins/`: Simple join operations
- `Basic Aggregate Functions/`: COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
- `Sorting and grouping/`: ORDER BY and GROUP BY operations
- `Advanced Select and joins/`: Complex select statements and join techniques
- `Subqueries/`: Nested queries and subquery techniques
- `Advanced String Functions / Regex / Clause/`: String manipulation, regex, and special clauses

Each solution includes the SQL code with explanations where appropriate.
